This project features a professional Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze survey data collected from participants. The goal was to extract actionable insights and present them in an intuitive, business-friendly format.

Highlights:

Data Cleaning & Modeling: Processed raw survey data using Power Query and DAX for accurate reporting.

Interactive Visualizations: Built dynamic visuals including bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, and slicers for real-time filtering.

User-Centric Design: Prioritized clarity and accessibility with a clean layout, making it easy to identify trends and key metrics.

Key Metrics Tracked: Overall satisfaction, recommendations, ratings breakdown, demographic insights, and participation trends.

This dashboard demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into meaningful, visually appealing insights that support data-driven decision-making.
